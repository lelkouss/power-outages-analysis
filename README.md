# Portfolio Homework for EECS 398: Practical Data Science

## Step 1: Introduction 
Provide an introduction to your dataset, and clearly state the one question your homework is centered around. Why should readers of your website care about the dataset and your question specifically? Report the number of rows in the dataset, the names of the columns that are relevant to your question, and descriptions of those relevant columns.

## Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis
- ### Data Cleaning: 
Describe, in detail, the data cleaning steps you took and how they affected your analyses. The steps should be explained in reference to the data generating process. Show the head of your cleaned DataFrame (see Part 2: Report for instructions).
- ### Univariate Analysis: 
Embed at least one plotly plot you created in your notebook that displays the distribution of a single column (see Part 2: Report for instructions). Include a 1-2 sentence explanation about your plot, making sure to describe and interpret any trends present, and how they answer your initial question. (Your notebook will likely have more visualizations than your website, and that’s fine. Feel free to embed more than one univariate visualization in your website if you’d like, but make sure that each embedded plot is accompanied by a description.)
- ### Bivariate Analysis: 
Embed at least one plotly plot that displays the relationship between two columns. Include a 1-2 sentence explanation about your plot, making sure to describe and interpret any trends present and how they answer your initial question. (Your notebook will likely have more visualizations than your website, and that’s fine. Feel free to embed more than one bivariate visualization in your website if you’d like, but make sure that each embedded plot is accompanied by a description.)
- ### Interesting Aggregates: 
Embed at least one grouped table or pivot table in your website and explain its significance.
- ### Imputation: 
If you imputed any missing values, visualize the distributions of the imputed columns before and after imputation. Describe which imputation technique you chose to use and why. If you didn’t fill in any missing values, discuss why not.

## Step 3: Framing a Prediction Problem 
- ### Problem Identification:
Clearly state your prediction problem and type (classification or regression). If you are building a classifier, make sure to state whether you are performing binary classification or multiclass classification. Report the response variable (i.e. the variable you are predicting) and why you chose it, the metric you are using to evaluate your model and why you chose it over other suitable metrics (e.g. accuracy vs. F1-score).
Note: Make sure to justify what information you would know at the “time of prediction” and to only train your model using those features. For instance, if we wanted to predict your Final Exam grade, we couldn’t use your Portfolio Homework grade, because we (probably) won’t have the Portfolio Homework graded before the Final Exam! Feel free to ask questions if you’re not sure.

## Step 4: Basline Model 
- ### Baseline Model: 
Describe your model and state the features in your model, including how many are quantitative, ordinal, and nominal, and how you performed any necessary encodings. Report the performance of your model and whether or not you believe your current model is “good” and why.

Tip: Make sure to hit all of the points above: many Portfolio Homeworks in the past have lost points for not doing so.
## Step 5: Final Model
